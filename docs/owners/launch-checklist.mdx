  This checklist compresses the README into a minimal flow with the extra context fork owners usually need.
</Callout>

## Complete in order

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Fork the GitHub repository

    Click **Fork** on the upstream project, choose a short repo name (e.g. `acme-forkast`), and set visibility according to your needs.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Import the fork into Vercel

    In the Vercel dashboard go to **Add New -> Project**, connect GitHub, pick the fork, and continue. Expect the first deploy to fail until secrets exist.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Provision Supabase

    From the project view open **Storage -> Supabase -> Create**, accept the defaults, and link the database to the project when prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure environment variables

    Download `.env.example`, fill in your values (Reown AppKit, Better Auth, admin wallets, etc.), then use **Import .env** inside **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run the production deploy

    Trigger the deploy after secrets are populated (for most teams this will be the first successful build). Confirm the site loads without errors.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Enable GitHub Actions on the fork

    In your forked repo open **Settings -> Actions -> General** and pick **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** so upstream sync workflows can run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick tips

- Sign in with every admin wallet shortly after launch to confirm access roles behave as expected.
- Store `CRON_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` in a secret manager so you can reuse them across preview and production environments.
