    or connect a crypto wallet such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet,
    OKX Wallet, or Binance Wallet.

## Social Sign-Up

Signing up with your email address or a social login provider is the quickest way to get started with {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}.
Supported options include **Google, X (Twitter), Discord, Farcaster, GitHub, Apple, and Facebook**.
This method is secure and requires no wallet setup.

## Crypto Wallet Sign-Up

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} also supports direct sign-up using a crypto wallet.
Popular wallets such as **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Binance Wallet** are supported through **Reown (formerly WalletConnect)**.

<Callout type="info">
When you connect with a wallet, your funds remain **fully in your control** — they are never held by {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}.
Reown is a secure connection layer that allows you to log in without creating a password and without giving custody of your assets.

## Tips

- If you have MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet browser extensions installed but wish to connect using their mobile apps,
  you may need to **disable the browser extension** and reload the page.
- You can always switch between login methods later if needed.
