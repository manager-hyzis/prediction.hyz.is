### Quick overview

- Trade outcome shares for questions like “Will Donald Trump retake the U.S.
  presidency in 2024?”.
- Shares trade between 0.00 and 1.00 USDC, and each opposing outcome pair (“YES” + “NO”) is fully backed by 1.00 USDC.
- New shares are minted when both sides agree on a price, so each trade remains
  fully collateralized.
- Winning shares redeem for 1.00 USDC when a market resolves, while losing
  shares expire at zero.
- You are always trading against other users, which means you can sell early,
  capture profits repeatedly, and you are never limited for winning too often.

### Understanding prices

Prices map directly to implied probabilities. If “YES” shares trade at 0.27
USDC, the market assigns a 27% chance to that outcome. As with equity markets,
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} does not set odds—supply and demand in the
order book does.

### Ways to profit

If you believe the market is underestimating an outcome, buy shares at the
current price. A correct resolution pays out 1.00 USDC, so a purchase at 0.27 USDC
returns 0.73 USDC per share. You can also sell at any time before settlement to
lock in gains or limit downside as prices move.

### Accuracy of the odds

Academic studies consistently show that prediction markets aggregate dispersed
knowledge more effectively than isolated forecasts, polls, or analysts. As more
informed traders join, they arbitrage mispriced contracts and push probabilities
closer to fair value. Whether you are seeking better insights about the future or
looking to monetize your expertise, {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} provides a
transparent, market-driven source of truth.
