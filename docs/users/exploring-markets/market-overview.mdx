## What is a Market?

A market represents a real-world question with possible outcomes, such as
**“Will candidate X win the election?”** or **“Will company Y launch a product this year?”**

Each market has:

- A **title** that states the question
- A list of **outcomes** (usually “Yes” / “No”, but can be multiple choices)
- A **price** for each outcome, shown as a percentage probability

## How Probabilities Work

Prices in {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} are expressed as probabilities:

- A price of **0.65 (65%)** means the market currently estimates a **65% chance** that the outcome will happen.
- If the outcome resolves as true, each share is worth **$1**.
- If false, the shares expire worthless.
