## Types of Orders

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} supports two primary order types:

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="Market orders" value="market">
    Execute immediately at the best available price in the order book. Choose
    this when you value speed and certainty of execution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit orders" value="limit">
    Set the exact price you are willing to pay or accept. The order remains
    open until another trader matches it, making limits ideal for precise
    pricing or larger trades.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
